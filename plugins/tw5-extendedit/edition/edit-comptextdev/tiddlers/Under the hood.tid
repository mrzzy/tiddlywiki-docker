title: Under the hood
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

I think the concept is quite mature now, but everything can still be revised/altered if needed.

* Started from the Widget edit-text.js to create  [[$:/plugins/snowgoon88/edit-comptext.js]] : ``edit-comptext`` Widget
* A module to compute the pixel position of the cursor : [[$:/plugins/snowgoon88/edit-comptext/cursor-position.js]]
* All the completion logic is in the [[$:/plugins/snowgoon88/edit-comptext/completion.js]] module.
* Small CSS additions in [[$:/plugins/snowgoon88/edit-comptext/edit-comptext.css]]
* Changed settings to say that  ''text/vnd.tiddlywiki'' editors should use ``comptext``

!! What I think still needs to be done :

* testing in various environment
** Linux+Firefox : OK
** Linux+Chromium : OK
** Win7+Firefox : OK
** Safari : ???
* ''TW5 spirit''
** Create the popupNode using more appropriate $tw5 methods ?
** ''WHERE'' in the DOM should I add the popup window ? Only one popup or one popup for each tidder ?
** Should I take care of removing the popup from the DOM ? When ? How ?
